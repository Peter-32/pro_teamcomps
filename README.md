Idea:

Scrape this website near the word >picks< and get the 5 champs chosen on each side

Have a lookup for any given champion, what their role is (classified into 11 roles by main role).

Ask questions like how many front/mid/backliners are most common?
ANSWER: 

Ask which roles are most popular?

Which duo of roles are most popular?


Also to start, use this site for the exact lookup dictionary:
