Idea:

Scrape this website near the word >picks< and get the 5 champs chosen on each side

Have a lookup for any given champion, what their role is (classified into 11 roles by main role).

Ask questions like how many front/mid/backliners are most common?
ANSWER: 
- 2 in the back.  (Always ADC and Mage, VERY RARELY ENCHANTERS (4% of games) so Janna should be a rare pick for me perhaps)
- The rest are front or middle, at least 1 in each line
- CONCLUSION: I suppose aim for 2 in the back is ideal.  That's all for line balancing.

Ask which roles are most popular?
- mage 20%
- diver 20%
- adc 15%
- vanguard 10%
- melee 10%
- CONCLUSION: I should play Annie mid, Warwick Jungle, Ashe ADC, Jax top, Taric Support

More insights:
- Usually 1 of each role among the top 5 roles in a team; I suppose mage is picked twice most often.


What combinations are interesting?
- If no engagement tank, then usually a warden tank or catcher engager
- If no diver, then probably a melee
- Usually 1 ADC and 1 mage


FINAL TEAM:
1 ADC
1 Mage
1 Engagement tank, warden, or catcher
2 divers, melees, or Juggernauts
Avoid playing: enchanters, battlemages.  Also avoid: assassins.  Avoid catchers unless it's the only choice


RECAP:
1 AD Carry
1 AP Carry
1 Tank (vanguard/warden) or catcher
2 Fighters (Melee or Diver or Juggernaut)
(Try to avoid enchanters, battlemages, and assassins)



***
Now try ML.  Block one random teammates and predict that teammate given the other 4 teammates
***

ML Results v1:
First step: Get a mage on the team
Second step: Get an ADC, but you can also go dual mages if you want.
Third step: Get a vanguard if you went dual mages
Fourth step: Go diver if you have the mage and ADC, but no diver yet.
Fifth step: If mage and ADC and diver then pick up melee

SHORT VERSION:
You need 2 backline characters: 2 mages or mage + ADC
If you have two mages you need extra support with a vanguard tank
If you have the standard mage + adc, have a diver on the team, then a melee.






If I divide roles into ADC, Mage/assassin, catcher/enchanter/warden, diver/fighter, other.  What are the common counts?
