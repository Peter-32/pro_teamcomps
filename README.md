Idea:

Scrape this website near the word >picks< and get the 5 champs chosen on each side

Have a lookup for any given champion, what their role is (classified into 11 roles by main role).

Ask questions like how many front/mid/backliners are most common?
ANSWER: 
- 2 in the back.  (Always ADC and Mage, VERY RARELY ENCHANTERS (4% of games) so Janna should be a rare pick for me)
- The rest are front or middle, at least 1 in each line

Ask which roles are most popular?
- mage 20%
- diver 20%
- adc 15%
- vanguard 10%
- melee 10%

More insights:
- Usually 1 of each role among the top 5 roles in a team; I suppose mage is picked twice most often.


Which duo of roles are most popular?
